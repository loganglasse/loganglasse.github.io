    <p>The Seattle Sounders started in 1974 in the NASL (North American Soccer League) where they played indoor and outdoor soccer professionally. The Seattle Sounders logo started out as a simple logo with just the name and two colors green and cyanish. The Seattle Sounders would start with a white jersey with blue stripes and a blue jersey with white strpies as their first ever jerseys. The Seattle Sounders started in Memorial Statium for the first two seasons and then moved to the Kingdome. This version of the Seattle Soudners though, would only last from 1974 to 1983.</p>

    <p>The Seattle Sounders would then come back to life in 1994 and played in the USL First DIvision (United Soccer Leagues First Division) where they played outdoor soccer professionally. The new Seattle Sounders logo would now change colors from green adn cyanish to turquois and blue. The logo also added an orca whale heading a soccer ball who would be soon known as Sammy the the Sounder. The new Seattle Sounders jerseys would be just plain white and blue with stripes going across from left to right. The new Seattle Sounders played Starfire Sports Complex which only held 4,500 people and was managed by Brian Schmetzer. This team lasted from 1994 to 2008.</p>
