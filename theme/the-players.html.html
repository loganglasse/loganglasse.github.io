            <p>Joevin Jones is one of my favorite players because he is what I aspire to be on the field. He is a player from Trinidad that was picked up by the Seattle Sounders FC to play on the wing and assist the strikers in order to score goals. Joevin Jones helped the Seattle Sounders FC get to all three of their MLS cups (won one and lost the next one is this year). He is tied for the second most assists in post season matches in the league.</p>

            <p>Jordan Morris is the one of my favorite players because he is the American player. He is one of the best players for the USMNT (United States Mens Natioanal Team). He was picked up by the Seattle Sounders FC out of college after his junior year at Stanford he was a homegrown player from Mercer Island which meant that he was able to be picked immediately by the Seattle Sounders FC with no one else able to try and get him. He helped the Seattle Sounders get to all three of their MLS cups and has won the Rookie of the Year award and Comeback Player of the Year award.</p>

            <p>Clint Dempsey is one of the best American players ever. He score the USMNT's fastest goal in history and has gone to the most World Cups for an American ever. He has the most goals ever for an American in the World Cup as well. He helped the Seattle Sounders FC get the their first two MLS Cups.</p>
