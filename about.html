        <p>Hi, I'm Logan Glasse</p>
            <img src="itsmelogan.jpg" alt="me">
        <p>I'm part of the Running Start program at Skyline High School working on trying to complete my high school requirements and get a head start on my college degree.

            I have no experience with programming but I'm interested in coding and computer science which I hope to boost my knowledge with through  programming.  I am interested in this class because of all the possibilities computer science and programming open up for you once you graduate.
                
            In my free time I like to play soccer and hangout with my friends.
                
            yeah
